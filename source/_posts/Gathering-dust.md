So what does it take to finally pull your thumb out and try to resurrect a $4k+ investment from a pile of parts gathering dust for 16 months? A cancer diagnosis - that and a mandatory quarantine from the world whilst recovering from the chemo. Fuck.

Components organized? Check. Dust removed? Check. Power? Check. POST? Fuck.

Remove all RAM, disconnect all peripherals. POST? Fuck. Remove motherboard from case to eliminate possible short circuit. POST? Fuck. Scratch head. RMA potential with sketchy mobo reseller extremely expired. But what is this? Supermicro has end-user support! Smack forehead. One email and they respond.

Have you tried with just one RAM stick? Yes. Can you try with another power supply? No. No? Then please RMA. Woohoo! For some reason the 3 year warranty didn't resonate last year. I am glad I didn't let it gather dust any longer.

Bought a PS voltage tester from Memory Express. PS voltage test looks fine.

RMA number received. Mobo packed and shipped. Supermicro insists that you not return any of the extras that were included with the motherboard. Thats good because I don't think they would have appreciated my custom sleeving!
