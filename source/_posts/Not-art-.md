It was looking so cool! Braided cables, clean chassis, good cable management, shiny cooler, lots of disks .... Too bad nothing happens when you press the power button. Nothing happens when you disconnect everything and press the power button. Nothing happens until you disconnect everything except the 16pin portion of the ATX cable - at which point, when you turn on the powersupply you finally see some life and the ps and case fans start to spin. But to my surprise, this odd ticking sound is emanating from the onboard speaker. Shit.

Actually its been in this sad state since the end of April. So bummed. And so, not in the mood to take it all apart, including removing the cpu cooler and the mess that entails, to determine the cause of the short. And since my build progress was laggard at best, any chance of a 30day RMA is long gone. Sigh.
