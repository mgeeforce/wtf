## Treebeard is taking shape##

Have made a lot of progress on Treebeard. I have installed all of the components back in the case now knowing we have a bootable environment. This is including a new 4 3.5" disk tool-less enclosure  and a 6 x 2.5" disk tool-less enclosure in the 5.25" slots - both from  ICY DOCK.

I am vacilating between PXE and USB booting - PXE is slow as shit since my dhcp/tftp/http boot server resides within a circa 2000 iMac running Tiger (10.4) and with only a 10BaseT Ethernet.
